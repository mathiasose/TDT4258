\section{Developing the game}
While developing the gamepad driver, we also began prototyping the game.
Since we had an existing implementation of the game \cite{2048} to reference,
the game mechanics were fairly straightforward to implement.

As the entire source code of the game is quite large, this section will only discuss the more (in our opinion) interesting parts of it.
The entire source code is attached to the report.

\subsection{Game board data structure\label{data_structure}}
The game is based around a simple 16-slot array representing a four by four grid of numbers.
Button presses causes the numbers to move around and merge,
and the updated array is translated to graphics that are shown on the gameboard screen.

Since the board was only to contain values of the form $v = 2^n$, it made sense to store $n$ instead of $v$. Only the case of $n = 0$ is different, as these are not to be displayed as tiles with the value $1$, but rather as empty tiles.

    \begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|}
        \hline
        0 & 0 & 0 & 0 &
        1 & 0 & 0 & 2 &
        0 & 0 & 2 & 3 &
        5 & 7 & 6 & 5 \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}

    \label{array_b}
\end{table}

    \caption{How the screen looks when \texttt{b} is as in table \ref{array_b}.}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Gamepad input}
Upon starting the game program, the gamepad driver listening is initialized by the function \texttt{init\_gamepad}.

\input{code/init_gamepad}

This sets up the program so that when the driver registers an interrupt, the function \texttt{sigio\_handler()} is called.

\input{code/sigio_handler}
The gamepad driver is accessed in the handler with \texttt{fgetc(device)}, which returns a bit string that represents the state of each of the eight buttons.
For this game, we were not interested in any button press combinations, so we used the function we defined in exercise 2 to map the input to a number representing a single button pressed.

\input{code/map_input}

The main function of the game has a loop that suspends at the end of each iteration.
When the driver registers an interrupt it is handled by the handler function, then the main loop updates the screen contents and suspends again.

\input{font}

\subsection{Putting everything together}
Now, with easy control of every single individual pixel and multiple fonts loaded into memory, we were ready to put everything together to make our game more or less equivalent to the web game.

The first step towards putting text on the screen was to put multiple character masks together into a single mask representing a string.
This mask of multiple characters we called a glyph, and we created a function that would create a glyph from a string of arbitrary length and a font.

\input{code/create_glyph}

\newpage
With this we could now draw the game board from the values in the array \texttt{b} (section \ref{data_structure}).

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=15cm]{img/boxmodel.png}
    \caption{Our tile box model.}
\end{figure}

From the position in the array we calculated the 60x60 pixel area of the framebuffer corresponding, and in this we drew a square colored according to the value in the array.

In this square area we also center-positioned a glyph created from the string represenation of the tile value,
and drew the pixels from this glyph in black "on top" of the colored tile.

\input{code/draw_tile}
