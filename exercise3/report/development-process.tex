\section{Development process}

The development part of this exercise was, as with the previous ones, done at the computer lab in the IT-Vest building at NTNU (room ITV-458). The lab is equipped with workstations connected to the EFM32GG-DK3750 development board made by Silicon Labs.
The subject staff provided us with a framework on which to base our work, more on this in section \ref{project-setup-toolchain}.
As per usual, we put the project under version control immediately to ease collaboration. Seeing as this is a multipart exercise, collaboration aided by version control became an important aspect of the process to a larger degree than in the previous exercises.

As mentioned above, the exercise consists of several parts. The two major ones; implementing a device driver for the gamepad connected to the board and implementing a game using said driver as an input interface. We decided upon which game to implement soon after reading the exercise requirements. This proved to be beneficial in the development of the driver, seeing as we had a clear image of how we wanted to interface with the driver.
