\section{Development process}

The development part of this exercise was, as with the previous ones, done at the computer lab in the IT-Vest building at NTNU (room ITV-458). The lab is equipped with workstations connected to the EFM32GG-DK3750 development board made by Energy Micro.
The subject staff provided us with a framework on which to base our work, more on this in section \ref{project-setup-toolchain}.
As per usual, we put the project under version control immediately to ease collaboration. Seeing as this is a multipart exercise, collaboration aided by version control became an important aspect of the process to a larger degree than in the previous exercises.
