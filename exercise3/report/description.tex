\chapter{Description \& Methodology}

This section describes the development process, use of tools, debugging techniques and details of the implementation. As listing entire implementations spread across several files for each development iteration would clutter the report and take away from the subject matter being discussed, we will only list code or formulas relevant to the task/section being described, not complete implementations. For details on the entire implementation, we refer to the source code attached to this report.
