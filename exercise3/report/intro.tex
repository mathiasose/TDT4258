\chapter{Introduction}

For the final exercise of the TDT4280 course, we will implement a simple game on the EFM32GG-DK3750.
It will be controlled with the same GPIO peripheral as in the previous exercises.
This time however, we will be running the game inside an operating system running on the development board.
A custom driver will be created to handle the GPIO inputs, and the game will utilize this to trigger different events.
