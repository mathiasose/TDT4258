\chapter{Conclusion}
We successfully implemented the same game as the web version we were copying.
We learned a lot about Linux device drivers, which we had no prior experience with,
as well as a lot of aspects of memory management we had never had to consider before.

The progression from the first to this final exercise has been a very good learning experience.
We can look back at the source code for the GPIO input handler from the first exercise and recognize that it is esentially the same thing we are doing in the device driver in the final exercise.
