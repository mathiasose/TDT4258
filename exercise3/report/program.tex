\section{Program}
The program we implemented is a clone of the (at the time of writing) very popular web game 2048. 

\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2048\_(video\_game)}

\subsection{Testing the program}
After flashing the correct OS and program build to the device, the device should automatically load the gamepad driver then start the game program.

\subsubsection{Playing the game}
Use the gamepad buttons SW1 through SW4 as directional buttons.

When one directional button is pressed, all tiles will move into empty tile spaces along the axis of movements.

Two equal tiles will merge into one tile equal to the sum of it's parts.

Score

Game over

\subsubsection{Restart game or exit game}
