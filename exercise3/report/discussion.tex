\subsection{Energy efficiency}
The main advantage of our game compared to many other games, is that the program can be suspended between user input.

When updating the screen contents it would be possible to select only specific regions of the screen to be updated, which would save some energy.
However in our case we opted to simply update the entire screen, justifying it with that the updating only happens after user input.

Tickless idle.
