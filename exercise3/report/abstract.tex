\chapter*{Abstract}

In this final exercise of the TDT4258 course, the group implemented a simple game on the EFM32GG development board, using the same gamepad peripheral as in the previous exercises to control the game.
As in the previous exercise the game was implemented in the C language and an ARM compatible GNU toolchain was used to build and flash the development board.
The difference from the previous exercise is theat for this one a Linux distro would first be flashed to the development board, and the game would be run inside this operating system.
A dedicated driver was written to facilitate communication between the game and the peripheral, through the OS and the hardware GPIO.
