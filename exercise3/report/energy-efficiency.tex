\section{Energy efficiency}
Using the eAProfiler tool, we took some readings of the running amperage while the development board was in different states.

\begin{table}[h!]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
        \hline
        State                           & Amperage \\ \hline
        OS idling, driver not loaded    & $10.25 mA$ \\ \hline
        OS idling, driver loaded        & $10.25 mA$ \\ \hline
        Game idling                     & $10.25 mA$ \\ \hline
        Button pressed in game          & $32.74 mA$ \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Amperage readings}
\end{table}

As we can see, loading the driver does not cause the baseline power consumption to increase.
The same goes for the game while nothing is happening, we see the power consumption stays in the same $mA$ range within two decimal points.
As expected, when a button is pressed, power consumption spikes.
The spike lasts for about $252.5ms$ from it starts to rise until it has fallen completely,
and in this range the amperage averages $32.74mA$.
