\subsection{Using the development board LED display}
As advised in the compendium, we used memory mapping to manipulate the image to be displayed.

\input{code/init_framebuffer}

This maps a region of memory, identified by the pointer \texttt{fbp}, to \texttt{/dev/fb0}, also known as the development board LED display.
Each 16-bit integer in this region represents the RGB565 color of a single pixel.
With this we were now able to draw shapes by iterating over the memory region and writing different values.
After changing pixels, the function \texttt{ioctl(fbfd, FB\_DRAW, \&screen)} is called to tell the screen to refresh the pixels in the \texttt{screen} area.

One thing we noticed and were confused by for quite some time was a black square region of ~5-10 pixels that would not go away.
It was eventually revealed to us that this was a cursor that uCLinux placed on the screen.
We were also told that this could be removed by running the command \texttt{echo 0 > /sys/class/graphics/fbcon/cursor\_blink} on the board.
