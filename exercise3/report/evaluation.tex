\chapter{Evaluation of assigment}

Definently challenging, but that is to be expected for the final exercise.
Getting to decide for ourselves which game to implement was very nice.

Some aspects of our implementation required lots of researching on our own to pull of, as it was not covered by the compendium.

\vspace{1em}

Suggestions for things to add to the compendium:
\begin{itemize}
    \item   Disabling the cursor that uCLinux displays on the screen.
    \item   Including other files with the game flash
    \item   Some pointers about how to implement font support, like how the .pbm format is much easier to parse than .bmp.
\end{itemize}
