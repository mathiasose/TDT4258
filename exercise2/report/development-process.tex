\section{Development process}

Most of the work on this excercise was carried out at the computer lab (room 458, IT-Vest, NTNU). The subject staff has equipped the lab with several workstations running Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. Each workstation is connected to an EFM32GG-DK3750 development board via USB. The toolchain necessary for cross-development is also preinstalled on each workstation. The subject staff also provided a project framework, containing amongst other things a Makefile with some convenient rules configured, a complete linkerscript and a header file containing many usefull memory addresses defined as pointer constants.

To facilitate some off-site development and to ease versioning and teamwork, the project was put under version control, see section \ref{other-tools}. The development process itself was very iterative, with a clear goal emerging after having successfully experimented with generating sound.
