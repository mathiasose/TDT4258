C programming allows and to some degree demands a paradigm quite unlike Assembly programming. Also, the usage of a compiler allows the programmer some slack when it comes to optimization, as the compiler will do optimizations on it's own. In this exercise we have indeed made some choices that might be sub-optimal, such as delegating a lot of functionality to helper functions, which makes the code more readable for a human but could be resource expensive when running the program.
