\subsection{Devices}
The device used in this exercise is the same as in the previous exercise, the EFM32GG-DK3570 produced by Silicon Labs. It has a built in Digital-Analog Converter which is the primary focus of the exercise.

While the DAC is physically connected to the main processing unit, it functions like a peripheral that must be manually activated before it can be used. A standard $3.5mm$ audio jack socket is available, meaning a normal set of headphones or earplugs can be connected to listen to the DAC output.

As in exercise 1 the only source of user input is the 8-button gamepad peripheral connected to the development board's GPIO pins. In this exercise the 8 LEDs on the gamepad are not the primary means of output, but they are still available if needed.
