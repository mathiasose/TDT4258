\chapter{Conclusion}

Both the practical goal and the learning goals of the exercise were achieved. Additional improvements to the program could have been implemented but we ran out of time. These have been mentioned in the discussion instead, so we have hopefully learned the theory of those if not how to do it practically.

Neither group member really had much relevant experience with timers, DACs, or the physics of sound in general, but the compendium \cite{compendium} and the EFM32GG Reference Manual \cite{efm32ggref} were very helpful for understanding, and with enough time to consider the material most of the work was very straightforward and easy to understand.
