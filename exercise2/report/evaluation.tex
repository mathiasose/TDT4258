\chapter{Evaluation of assigment}

This exercise provided a lot of valuable experience for both group members. Expanding on the knowledge we acquired in exercise 1, it posed enough of a challenge to be interesting, but not so much that it became overwhelming and felt unfeasible. Having some expreience with C(++) from the TDT4102 course, the exercise allowed us to use and learn more about using the C language for programming microcontrollers.

The subject staff provided valuable insight and aid during the tuition hours. One criticism that has been mentioned to the staff is the heat situation in the lab. The extreme temperature that develops by only being a few people in the room at the same time makes it really hard to work over long time periods, possibly discouraging creativity and innovation.
