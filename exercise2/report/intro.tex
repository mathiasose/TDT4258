\chapter{Introduction}

In this exercise we take the step from Assembly programming to C programming on the EFM32GG-DK3750. Having already learned how to implement simple GPIO handling in exercise 1, we now move on to the built-in Digital-Analog Converter (DAC) to generate sound. This is to be combined with GPIO input and timerbased interrupts to allow different sound effects to play on different button presses.

As in exercise 1, we will also keep in mind that a secondary but important objective of the exercise should be to try to keep energy efficiency high. Both the energy level when playing sound and the energy level while idling should be observed and measures taken to reduce it.

The primary objective of this exercise, in addition to familiarizing ourselves with new peripherals on the development board and C programming, is implementing at least three short sound effects that can be used in a game, as well as at least one song/melody that plays upon startup.
