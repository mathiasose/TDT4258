\chapter{Evaluation of Assignment}
The exercise provided a very good learning experience. None of the group members could boast any significant prior experience with the technologies used in the exercise, only some theoretical knowledge from the TDT4160 course. The exercise allowed this knowledge to be used practically, and introduced many new concepts as well.

One criticism worth mentioning is the fact that we struggled with the sleep mode enabling. Even though we followed instructions and the student assistant could not see any errors when inspecting the code, the device would not go to sleep. The resolution of this problem was as inexplicabe as the cause. It seems there might be some additional criteria for going to sleep that we are not explicitly aware of, and had to stumble upon instead. Since energy efficiency is emphasised in this subject, the seemingly arbirtrariness of this is frustrating.
