\section{Project setup and toolchain description}

After downloading and untarring the support files for this exercise, we chose to reorganize the project structure slightly. We decided upon the directory layout in listing \ref{lst:directory-layout}

\begin{lstlisting}[label=lst:directory-layout,caption=Directory layout]
exercise1
|-- Makefile
|-- NOTES
|-- efm32gg.ld
|-- lib
|   |-- efm32gg.s
|   |-- vector.s
|-- report
|   |-- \ldots
|-- src
    |-- main.s
\end{lstlisting}

Following this, we made the necessary edits to the Makefile, updating all rules with the new directory layout. As can be seen from listing \ref{lst:directory-layout}
