\chapter{Description and Methodology}
The exercise was primarily done in the computer lab (room 458 at IT-Vest, NTNU). The source code was put in an online git repository allowing some minor work to be done off-site before it could be tested in the lab.
The lab had already been set up with multiple workstations with a stationary computer running Ubuntu 12.04 LTS with the neccessary software already installed, connected via USB to an EFM32GG-DK3750 development kit.
The exercise description was made available in a compendium also containing instructions about how to write and run the program. Also described was how to use the GNU Debugger to troubleshoot. A student assistant was also available for some hours every week to help.
The program itself was developed iteratively, with lots of trial and error.
