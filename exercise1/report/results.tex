\chapter{Results and Tests}

Using the Energy monitoring tool we observed the board idling on a power consumption level of about
$2.0 \mu A$ while running the final iteration of the program with sleep mode enabled.

[INCLUDE PIC]

According to [http://www.cr2032battery.org/cr2032-lithium-battery/] a cr2032 "coin cell" battery can
last up to 5 years while in use before deteriorating too much. One manufacturer claims
[http://www.cr2032.co/cms/prodimages/energizer\_cr2032\_datasheet.pdf] their battery has a typical capacity of $240 mAh$.

\[
	240 mAh / 2.0 uA = 120 000 h
\]

5000 days or 13.7 years. In other words the battery will deteriorate before discharging from use for this microcontroller running this idling program.
