In this exercise, the group learned the basics of developing and running programs on the EFM32GG-DK3750 development board, including communication between the board and a prototype gamepad. Each group member acquired knowledge of the internal workings of the EFM32GG microcontroller, of programming for the ARM Cortex-M3 processor and the GNU-toolchain.
