\chapter*{Abstract}
In this exercise, the group learned the basics of developing and running programs on the EFM32GG-DK3750 development board, including communication between the board and a prototype gamepad. Each group member acquired knowledge of the internal workings of the EFM32GG microcontroller, of programming for the ARM Cortex-M3 processor and of the GNU-toolchain.
We chose to implement a simple way of controlling the LEDs on the gamepad, a one-to-one mapping between pressing $button_n$ and $LED_n$ turning on. Additionally, we implemented a simple animated sequence of flashing LEDs. All code was written in ARM assembly using the Thumb-2 instruction set. To achieve energy efficiency, we implemented a solution using interrupts, as opposed to busy-loop polling.
