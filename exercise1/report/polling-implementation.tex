\subsection{Polling implementation}
\label{sec:polling-implementation}

Having successfully configured and enabled LEDs, we moved on to reading input from GPIO port C. At this point we decided that the functionality of our program would be a simple mapping between each button and a corresponding LED. This simple functionality would allow us to focus more on energy efficiency.

Having already enabled the GPIO clock in the CMU, setting up pins 0-7 on port C for input required little work. Simply enabling input in the port C pin mode low register (GPIO\_PC\_MODEL) and writing \texttt{0xFF} to the port C data out register did the trick.

\begin{lstlisting}[label=enable-gpio-input, caption=Enabling input on port C]
LDR T0, =0x33333333
STR T0, [GPIO_I, #GPIO_MODEL]
LDR T0, =0xFF
STR T0, [GPIO_I, #GPIO_DOUT]
\end{lstlisting}

Subsequently, we implemented a main loop, constantly polling the port C data in register (GPIO\_PC\_DIN), and pushing processed data to the port a data out register (GPIO\_PA\_DOUT). Seeing as pressing a button pulls the corresponding pin to ground, and LEDs are enabled by setting a pin low, all we had do to map the press of a button to the enabling of an LED, was shift the 8 least significant bits in the bitstring from GPIO\_PC\_DIN 8 bits left and write the resulting string to GPIO\_PADOUT.
