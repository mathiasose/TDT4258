\section{Debugging}

As with most development processes, debugging played an essential part throughout our work on this exercise. Since we chose to use Vim as out main editor, the GDB capabilities built into Emacs were unavailable to us. Instead, we ran GDB directly from a terminal. In order to debug the program running on the development board, we needed a bridge between our local GDB session and the board. Luckily for us, the development board is equipped with a SEGGER JLink debugging interface. With the supplied \texttt{.gdbinit} and the \texttt{JLinkGDBServer} program installed on the lab workstation, we could start a GDB instance connected to the program running on the development board using the command \texttt{arm-none-eabi-gdb <elf-file>}. Our use of GDB in this exercise did not extend beyond stepping through instructions, placing breakpoints and inspecting register and memory values.
